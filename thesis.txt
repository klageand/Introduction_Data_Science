
### What the mice learned

At first glance, it appeared as if two of the three mice (blue and red) learned to navigate the visual cue to locations associated with a presented odor in the $bidirectional$ stage with a maximum distance of 1 and one of the three mice (blue) even in the $bidirectional$ stage with a maximum distance of 2 (figures \@ref(fig:noMicroSteps-performance), \ref{no_ms_eventual}). 

However, closer examination suggests that only the blue marked mouse might have learned an actual odor-location association in the short time (i.e. in the post-acquisition trials) before progressing to a maximum distance of 2. This is indicated (1) by a higher than chance performance for both odors in trials where the start location was the middle location (**link**), (2) consistent choices - initial and eventual - of a side, when presented a certain odor (figures \ref{no_ms_eventual}B, \ref{no_ms_init}B), which results in (3) similar path length (of about 1) in rewarded trials for both odors when the start location is the middle location (fig. \@ref(fig:noMicroStepsPathlengths)A) and (4) similar trial durations in trials with lateral start locations (fig. \@ref(fig:noMicroStepsPathlengths)C), suggesting that the decisions were made similarly confidently for both odors. The possible alternative of a learned odor-direction association seems to be unlikely, since the trial durations for each presented odor are similar when the start location is left or right from the location associated with the presented odor (fig. \@ref(fig:middle-vs-lateral)). 

When the blue marked mouse progressed to a maximum distance of 2, not only did the performance drop (fig. \@ref(fig:noMicroSteps-performance)), but also the side bias returned. 



Although the red marked mouse also reached the criterion to progress to a maximum distance of 2, it did not seem to have actually learned an odor-location association. This is indicated by mostly choosing to initially turn the wheel to the left side, independent of which odor is presented (figures \@ref(fig:olalTrainingGeneral)C, \ref{no_ms_init}C), which then results in a longer path lengths and trial durations in rewarded trials, when a right wheel turn is required (fig. \@ref(fig:noMicroStepsPathlengths), \@ref(fig:middle-vs-lateral)). 

The white marked mouse seemed to have had a similar approach. During the original experimental design it initially turned the wheel mostly to the right side, independent on the presented odor (figures \@ref(fig:olalTrainingGeneral)C, \ref{no_ms_init}A). Different however from the red marked mouse, it did not seem to correct its initial choices, which is indicated by similar path lengths and trial durations for both sides in rewarded trials (figures \@ref(fig:noMicroStepsPathlengths, \@ref(fig:middle-vs-lateral)). It might rather randomly obtain rewards when a left wheel turn is required through explorative behaviour.
 







The red marked mouse might have persued a similar strategy as 


 - seemed that blue learned maxdist 1 and 2 
 - seemed that red learned maxdist 1
 - white didn't learn anything
 - -> all eventual choices
However:
 - initial choices suggest that mice turn wheel first to one side and if that doesn't work to the other side
 - additional evidence: number of locations visited --> higher variance implies less certainty
 
 - espeacially initial choices of intermediate locations and comnplete design uncover the strategy that is persued:
 - -> turn wheel to one side, if that doesn't work, to the other side
 
 - furthermore: overall high percentage of activity (% of trials with at least 1 location change) shows that mice learned, that moving the wheel is required for reward
 - however high percentage of wiggles indicates that mice did not understand how to use the wheel properly
 - however: **what do the hit/miss ratios mean?** -> just reflects side bias of white and the absence of a side bias of red
 
 
 - wiggles might actually be an artifact of the training: low thresholds with maxdist 1 yields rewards for wiggles
 
 - increase of olfactory saliancy had no effect on white and red and probably not on blue
 - although perfomance improved after increase, initial choices imply that strategy is turn left then right
 - -> but alis paper showed that mice should be able to discriminate even with initial flow volume
 
decrease in participation:
 - it might be that mice got frustrated after introduction of maxdist 2 --> drop in participation
 - hypothesis: mice struggle to connect viscue movement with wheel --> solution: intermediate locations
 - -> neither performance nor trials per day increased 
 - -> either mice were already too frustrated and confused by what they learned and experienced before
 - -> or wheel-movement connection is not the problem
 - -> or threshold is still too high --> continuous movement required

 - -> low accuracy could be explained by all of the above
 - -> low participation hints to frustration **maybe find reference that associate frustration with participation**
